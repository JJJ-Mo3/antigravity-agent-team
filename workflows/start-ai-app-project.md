# Start AI App Project

This workflow initializes the AI Team with **AI Application specialization**.

**Context Loaded:** `agents/specializations/ai-app/`

## Steps

1.  **Set Project Type**
    Agents will use `PROJECT_TYPE="ai-app"`.

2.  **Run Product Manager**
    ```bash
    /run-pm
    ```
    *Focus: Token costs, Latency, Streaming UI, Model selection.*

3.  **Continue with Standard Workflow**
    Follow `/start-project`. Agents will design for vector databases (pgvector), LangChain/LangGraph integration, and streaming responses.

# Start Mobile App Project

This workflow initializes the AI Team with **Mobile Development specialization**.

**Context Loaded:** `agents/specializations/mobile/`

## Steps

1.  **Set Project Type**
    The agents will automatically detect `PROJECT_TYPE="mobile"` from the context if you use this workflow.

2.  **Run Product Manager**
    ```bash
    /run-pm
    ```
    *Focus: Mobile gestures, offline-first, app store compliance.*

3.  **Continue with Standard Workflow**
    Follow the standard steps in `/start-project`, but Agents will use mobile-specific stacks (React Native, Expo, SQLite/WatermelonDB).

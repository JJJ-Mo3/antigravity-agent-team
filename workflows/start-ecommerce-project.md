# Start E-commerce Project

This workflow initializes the AI Team with **E-commerce specialization**.

**Context Loaded:** `agents/specializations/ecommerce/`

## Steps

1.  **Set Project Type**
    Agents will use `PROJECT_TYPE="ecommerce"`.

2.  **Run Product Manager**
    ```bash
    /run-pm
    ```
    *Focus: Catalog management, Cart complexity, Payment gateways, Inventory.*

3.  **Continue with Standard Workflow**
    Follow `/start-project`. The Data Analyst agent will heavily prioritize conversion funnels and GMV metrics.
